Only look at the folders,
Ignore the java files scattered in the main directory. I can't figure out how to delete them.

Generally, the highest numbered version is the one with the latest version of whatever I'm working on.
Currently, a4_MVC is the most functional.

The main method is in Controller.
Copy and paste all the files from the highest numbered version into a package and run the main method in controller
DO NOT run the main method in view. That is just to make sure that view can function without model.
